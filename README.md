Welcome.\
This is **Antimatter**, a Discord Chatbot just for fun!\
The first Alpha launch of the bot was Anti1 on repl.it, and it was written in python.\
This project is currently private, and therefore **you** are allowed to see my code or contact me on discord : Annyeong1#8912\

Here are some links.
>Source code of it, Anti1, is currently public and can be found here:
